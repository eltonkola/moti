## :scroll: Description
This is the week 4 for Android Dev Challenge Finale: Weather app

Moti means weather in Albanian.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
My goal was to create a simple ui, using a main image for the user's location, and then play with colors and alpha.
I used a free weather api, with basic weather information, so i can use this app on daily basis, instead of using a more mainstream api with limited nr of call per day/month.
